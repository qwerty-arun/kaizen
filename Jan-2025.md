  # Key Learnings
  ## Journal of Aerospace sciences and technologies
  - A brief introduction to the Pad Abort Test conducted by ISRO
  - Crew Escape System working, Crew Module
  - Demonstration of launch pad abort capability, self-reorientation of Crew-module and parachute systems.
  - Different motors used: Low altitude escape motor (LEM), High altitude escape motor (HEM), Pitch Motor (PM) and CES Jettisoning motor (CJM).
  - Various challenges: range to be acheived = 400 m, 2.5km min altitude, orientation of the module, angle of attack so that parachutes deploy properly, parachute deployment without string entanglement.
  ## C++
  - Revisited prev notes.
  - Introduction to strings.

  # Key Learnings
  ## Home Automation Project (how to go about it?)
  - First find technical papers (At least 15), find something common and get an idea of what exists
  - Find youtube videos on already implemented projects
  - Find out all types of gadgets in the market
  - Find out what unique thing can you do.
  - Why not publish a paper? Start a business? Start a company?

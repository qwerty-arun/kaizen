  ## Andrew Huberman Podcast: How to develop focus
  - Importance of Visual focus and how to develop it so as to master focus in general.
  - Hormones like epinephrin and acetocoline.
  - How long can you focus on a specific visual area? These are tests that you should perform. You don't need to focus entire day.
  - Auditory learners tend to close their eyes when they are listening intensely so as to focus.
  - Visual cues are tricky, you must learn a way to quickly get back your focus as it tends to drift away.
  - You need to master your sleep schedule. Learn what works best for you.
  - Non Sleep Deep Rest Protocol for 20 min everyday.
  - Every learning session should be of 90 min maximum.
  ## Alex Hormonzi podcast on Niche - hopping
  - Uninformed optimism -> Informed Pessimism -> Get through shit (Focus) -> Informed Optimism (Solution phase) -> Acheivement (potential of the idea)
  - Confront every problem you have instead of running away from it.
  - What good will pursuing many goals help? You'll run too thin.
  - Sure you'll develop many skill sets, but to use them regularly is the main challenge. You don't want to stay at level one at everything.
  - The more skill sets you acquire, the more you have to say 'NO' to opportunities.
  - Marketplace wants new, but business world wants better.

  # Key Learnings
  ## Expert Talk: "Non-conventional start-up in India" by Kaushik Mudda, CEO at Ethereal Machines
  - How it started as a small project in a garage
  - How it was hard back then in 2014 to start a company
  - How he didn't make any money during the first few years
  - How he sacrificed many things
  - How to get your employees to work or juniors to get work done: Don't simply tell them what to do, you have to earn their respect by "Being so good they can't ignore you". You have to be one early and leave the last. You need to prove that you are good.
  - How to build a very good team? You have to be at the top of your game.
  - Just start: what are you waiting for? But start it for good reasons.
  - How he got to sell his first machine
  - Why he built a precision CNC machine and knew it would stay at least for the next two decades or so.
  - The company specializes in making 5-10 micrometer precision CNC machines.
  - They were the first ones to build such a thing in India back then when volume of import of machines were way too high.

  ## C++ : SFML tutorials
  - Drawing a rectangle
  - Keyboard input: HJKL to move the rectangle, but without boundary conditions
  - Mouse input: moving the top left corner of the rectangle to the point where you click the mouse.
  - Important point: the mouse position will be with respect the screen you are using and not the window which you generate, how do you change that?

  # Key Learnings
  - Git setup in local machine (virtual machine: Kali Linux)
  - What is CMake? What are build dependencies?
  ## Our Experiential Learning Project: Multilingual voice activated home automation system
  - Wrote the code for interfacing Arduino Uno with two relays, one buzzer, one PC fan and one servo motor.
  - Problems that occurred: While we turn the servo motor manually, the fun turns on for a split second which means the servo motor doesn't have reverse current protection which is a problem.
  - We are trying to put a diode in series.
  - We are implementing the project for three languages: English, Hindi and Kannada.
  - Voice activation works in all the three languages.
  ## Exhibition in our College Library
  - Recommended books like autobiographies of Steve Jobs, Elon Musk (by Ashlee Vance and Walter Isaacson)
  - Also "What's your dream?" by Simon Squibb
  ## SFML Tutorials
  - Windows: open and close, resize
  - Window Events: resize, close
  - Text Event: Entering text on the terminal

  # Key Learnings
  - C++ : Complete STL Tutorial
  - OnShape: Desgined my own earbud
  - NPTEL Course: Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems assignments
  - General Reading: Kalman filters and why there are used: When you have multiple sensors prone to noise or you want to measure a parameter of interest indirectly.
  - A car going through a tunnel, you have various sensors onboard: Guidance and Nav, Odometer and GPS but GPS signals will be noisy in a tunnel so you will have to `estimate` your position.
  - Temperature inside a rocket nozzle: you can't just place a sensor inside as it will melt. Place a sensor on the outside wall of the nozzle and estimate the temperature.
  - C++ Web Frameworks: Drogon, Crow, Nui , Beast. Even with simple C++ code, you will be able to build such cool stuff.
  - How to build games in C++? SFML, Raylib, OpenGL. Well you don't need to know advanced C++ coding, you just need to know pointers, STL, structs and classes, files etc.

  - [Rise of Elon Musk. How did he build Tesla and SpaceX?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoQR9rLpRy8)
  - How did he do the impossible?
  - [Robots as tiny as insects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6q6pYZ9Fho)
  ## C++ (DSA)
  - Single element in a sorted array
  - Book allocation problem
  ## General Reading
  ### Harvard Business Review (Articles)
  - Electronic monitoring of employees decreases productivity
  - Entrepreneurs should test their hypothesis before entering the market
  - Personalities of various CEOs and their connection with Marketing and sales
  - High performers quit if they don't make as much as new hires (if they are better). If compensation is given, then they are more likely to stay.
  ### ISRO's PAT (Pad Abort Test)
  - Specification of CES (crew escape system) and CM (crew module). CES: 6.5 tonnes and CM: 3.7 tonnes. Max possible deviation allowed: + or - 3%
  - In Moment of inertia : + or - 10% (Why?)
  - Yaw, pitch and roll constraints
  - The jettisoning problem: The CES and CM should seperate without collision. Factors that play a crucial role: atmosphere pressure, angle of attack, the motors which fire the CES to seperate, stability of CM after seperation.
  - The motors are supposed to generate 250kN of thrust in just 0.2 sec (WOW). Won't this stress out the materials due to sudden changes in temperature? What about inertia?
  - During the re-entry: the apex cover which covers the Crew Module(CM) is supposed to seperate first without collision with the CM. Or else the parachute won't deploy at all.
  - Min height to be achieved: 2.5km above surface
  - Questions: What are the various sensors to test various parameters that are used? What are some of the advanced materials that are used in the aerospace sector?
  ## College Stuff
  - Design flow of VLSI chip design: Cost of error propagation as we progress towards physical design.
  - Implementation of Linear phase filters: FIR and IIR. Direct structures, lattice structures, transpose structure.

  ## Andrew Huberman Podcast: How to develop focus
  - Importance of Visual focus and how to develop it so as to master focus in general.
  - Hormones like epinephrin and acetocoline.
  - How long can you focus on a specific visual area? These are tests that you should perform. You don't need to focus entire day.
  - Auditory learners tend to close their eyes when they are listening intensely so as to focus.
  - Visual cues are tricky, you must learn a way to quickly get back your focus as it tends to drift away.
  - You need to master your sleep schedule. Learn what works best for you.
  - Non Sleep Deep Rest Protocol for 20 min everyday.
  - Every learning session should be of 90 min maximum.
  ## Alex Hormonzi podcast on Niche - hopping
  - Uninformed optimism -> Informed Pessimism -> Get through shit (Focus) -> Informed Optimism (Solution phase) -> Acheivement (potential of the idea)
  - Confront every problem you have instead of running away from it.
  - What good will pursuing many goals help? You'll run too thin.
  - Sure you'll develop many skill sets, but to use them regularly is the main challenge. You don't want to stay at level one at everything.
  - The more skill sets you acquire, the more you have to say 'NO' to opportunities.
  - Marketplace wants new, but business world wants better.

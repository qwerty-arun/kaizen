  - How did he do the impossible?
  - [Robots as tiny as insects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6q6pYZ9Fho)
  ## C++ (DSA)
  - Single element in a sorted array
  - Book allocation problem
  ## General Reading
  ### Harvard Business Review (Articles)
  - Electronic monitoring of employees decreases productivity
  - Entrepreneurs should test their hypothesis before entering the market
  - Personalities of various CEOs and their connection with Marketing and sales
  - High performers quit if they don't make as much as new hires (if they are better). If compensation is given, then they are more likely to stay.
  ### ISRO's PAT (Pad Abort Test)
  - Specification of CES (crew escape system) and CM (crew module). CES: 6.5 tonnes and CM: 3.7 tonnes. Max possible deviation allowed: + or - 3%
  - In Moment of inertia : + or - 10% (Why?)
  - Yaw, pitch and roll constraints
  - The jettisoning problem: The CES and CM should seperate without collision. Factors that play a crucial role: atmosphere pressure, angle of attack, the motors which fire the CES to seperate, stability of CM after seperation.
  - The motors are supposed to generate 250kN of thrust in just 0.2 sec (WOW). Won't this stress out the materials due to sudden changes in temperature? What about inertia?
  - During the re-entry: the apex cover which covers the Crew Module(CM) is supposed to seperate first without collision with the CM. Or else the parachute won't deploy at all.
  - Min height to be achieved: 2.5km above surface
  - Questions: What are the various sensors to test various parameters that are used? What are some of the advanced materials that are used in the aerospace sector?
  ## College Stuff
  - Design flow of VLSI chip design: Cost of error propagation as we progress towards physical design.
  - Implementation of Linear phase filters: FIR and IIR. Direct structures, lattice structures, transpose structure.

  # Key Learnings
  ## Andrew Huberman Podcast: How to develop focus
  - Importance of Visual focus and how to develop it so as to master focus in general.
  - Hormones like epinephrin and acetocoline.
  - How long can you focus on a specific visual area? These are tests that you should perform. You don't need to focus entire day.
  - Auditory learners tend to close their eyes when they are listening intensely so as to focus.
  - Visual cues are tricky, you must learn a way to quickly get back your focus as it tends to drift away.
  - You need to master your sleep schedule. Learn what works best for you.
  - Non Sleep Deep Rest Protocol for 20 min everyday.
  - Every learning session should be of 90 min maximum.
  ## Alex Hormonzi podcast on Niche - hopping
  - Uninformed optimism -> Informed Pessimism -> Get through shit (Focus) -> Informed Optimism (Solution phase) -> Acheivement (potential of the idea)
  - Confront every problem you have instead of running away from it.
  - What good will pursuing many goals help? You'll run too thin.
  - Sure you'll develop many skill sets, but to use them regularly is the main challenge. You don't want to stay at level one at everything.
  - The more skill sets you acquire, the more you have to say 'NO' to opportunities.
  - Marketplace wants new, but business world wants better.

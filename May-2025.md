  - Yaw can only be achieved with reference to an object
  - At heights less than 1000ft, object details are absolutely necessary
  - Monocular cues to depth and distance: linear perspective, arial perspective, texturing and texture gradients, motion parallax
  - Advantages of large areas: They can provide smooth, seamless imagery across the simulated terrain. Whereas for a small area: repeated loading and unloading of images
  - Scene complexity is defined in terms of no. of polygons
  - Sound: wind, rain and hail striking on windscreen, tire braking and skidding
  - Sound is a very effective alerting stimulus because it doesn't need any orientational input
  - Higher freq. of sound need to be presented at higher decibel level in order to be audible
  - Placement of speakers (localization) becomes very important
  - To Learn: Spatial Audio
  - Stewart platforms used in simulators

  ## What is so special about the Silicon Valley?

  - Next big thing always starts out being dismissed as "toy"
  - They try many experiments all at once. They never stop trying to find their "thing"
  - Actually a new Idea is always welcomed with skepticism in India
  - "I will help you now, you can help later" attitude
  - No one wants you to attempt the hard stuff
  - Attitude of risk taking is embedded into their culture
  - "If you aren't failing, you are not innovating enough"
  - India penalizes and hates failures. Failures are permanent here. It kinda leaves a "black mark" on your career
  - Best founders are both marketing and product geniuses

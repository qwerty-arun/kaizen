  # Key Learnings

  ## MiniShell Project
  - Complete! A Complete basic linux shell written in C++.
  - Some improvements can be done but, that is for later
  - I need to take some screenshots and screen recordings

  ## C++ Audio Plugin
  - Project Setup is done
  - On my way to create first effect in music

  ## Minor Project 
  - How various drugs behave in microgravity.
  - Parameters that affect: temperature, pressure, O2 levels, CO2 levels, humidity, UV intensity, solvent properties, Gas Composition etc.

  ## 6th Sem Skill Lab Day-2
  - Microwave Amplifer Design, S2P file and Transistor Files
  - Transistor: GAN HEMT: CGH40010, 10W power, upto 4GHz, VDS = 28V and IDS = 200mA
  - Impedance Matching  of circuits using lumped elements, stubs etc.
  - All done on ADS
  - Importance of using less number of elements. Pi network, network based purely on stubs  etc.
  - Choke using inductors. For transistor's gate we give both VDC and VAC. We also use a series capacitor and a shunt inductor with a VDC in series with Inductor. The inductor is connected to the gate of the MESFET.
  - The capacitor block DC components (AC input is given here) and the inductor blocks and AC component from entering the VDC source.

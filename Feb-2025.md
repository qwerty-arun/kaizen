  # Key Learnings
  - Elon Musk Book: His journey through Roadster and Model S Car
  - Flight Without Formula: Cambers on top surface and bottom surface of the wing, slots and flaps, different types of flaps, Aspect Ratio: Ratio of span(length) to its chord (breadth), wings with higher aspect ratio have less induced drag, disadvantages: added weight and more difficult to manoeuvre, more space in hangar etc.
  - [Mandelbrot Set](https://mathigon.org/course/fractals/mandelbrot). Great visuals provided.
  - SFML: Bezier Curve complete implementation, Sierpinski Triangle Generation
  - SFML Ideas: Can I project a 3D cube on the window? Can I rotate it to create an animation? Can I build a tesseract? Can I actually visualize 4D or at least try to?
  - OnShape: Making of eyewear: frames. A small introduction to FeatureScript, a native language developed by Onshape, making a slot feature.

  # Key Learnings
  - Elon Musk Book
  - Difference between rasterization and ray-tracing. Ray-tracing being image centric and rasterization being object-centric.
  - Processes involved in rasterization: Projection of 3D coordinates on to raster space of 2D. Then checking if pixels are within the 2D triangles (projected).
  - Good read for [Rasterization](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/overview-rasterization-algorithm.html)
  - Flight and different types of drag what it depends on
  - SFML: Drew a basic 3rd degree Bezier Curve, made a simple 2D asteroid game 
  - DSA: 2D matrices: search-I and search-II, spiral matrix
  - Wingtip vortices: [YT-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyKwrU7fRY4), [YT-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnB6Lqr91Yc) and [YT-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFgbUx1GdxM).

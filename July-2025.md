# Machine Learning Repo
- Fixed all the structure of the repo, now it is perfectly organized
- Revised Unsupervised learning
- Finished Advanced Learning Algorithms course by DeepLearning.AI
- Practiced Python programs again, now everything is in one repo
- Updated AI agents course on my repo, planning to carry forward

# LinkedIn
- Updated my about section
- Added the droply project
- Added "Advanced Learning Algorithms" course certificate
- Removed Google AI essentials course (not worth it)

# General
- Learnt about Trust Act of India
- Learnt different rules related to trusts
- Is there anything better than Virtual Machines. I want to delete the current one.

# DSA

# Python
- Practiced programs again
- Started with OOPs

# Hugging Face - AI Agents Course
- Continued with smolagents
- Used my free API key a maximum
- Now, I can't run the notebooks

# Ollama download
- Downloaded for both windows and virtual machine
- `ollama run gemma3:1b` becoz it is a lightweight model
- Created a http request
- ollama pip package download
- Create a custom LLM: `ollama create mario -f ./Modelfile`
- Modelfile contains info about the new model
- Visit `localhost:11434` to see if ollama is running or not
- Installed Docker on linux
- pulled `open-webui` image
- went to `localhost:8080` and signed up as admin, need to create users and do some operations on that

# Docker and python
- Created a simple linear regression model in python
- Built using docker
- Need to publish on docker hub
- Uses numpy and matplotlib

# venv and ML libraries
- Created another python3.12 on my computer
- Create two seperate venv: `tfenv` and `myenv`. 
- `tfenv` uses 3.12 and has libraries like: tensorflow, pandas, matplotlib, numpy
- `myenv` uses 3.13 and has: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pytorch, matplotlib
- **Python points to the version of python inside the venv"

# DeepLearning.AI course revision
- Ran all the notebooks once again for better understanding
- Done till gradient descent

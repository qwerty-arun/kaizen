  ## Key Learnings
   ### MATLAB
   - Simulation of ASK modulator and demodulator using Simulink
   - Introduction to Bernoulli binary generator
   - Extending ASK to achieve FSK which is nothing but addition of two ASK signals

  ## Key Learnings
  - C++ : Program terminated with signal SIGFPE, arithmetic exception error. Different data types. `void` is a special case. You can `return void()` from a function or just `return`. Review of Substring program (longest substring of non-repeating characters).
  - Before you StartUp book: Five major themes: Product, Competition, Cash, Legal System and Team
  - PCB Designing: Finished adding footprints, placed components roughly on the PCB
  - MATLAB: Basics of simulink and how to use it. Example projects: mobile rover, self-balancing robot, race car, automatic guitar tuner.
  - Some basics to be learnt: PID Control, low pass filtering, curve fitting, mean, median, std, scatter plot, FFT, inv of matrix, image segmentation, deep learning, optimization.

  ## Key Learnings
  - C++ for 3 hours
  - PCB designing: Finished the schematic design of STM32 + RF integration module. Learnt antenna impedance matching.
  - Dopamine Detox Book finished
  - Newton's Cradle Explained: Conservation of energy/momentum seems to be the wrong approach to explain it. There is something called Hertz's adjustment to Hookes' law
  - Reviewed some companies that specialise in RF domain
  - Project Based Learning in C: Writing a shell in C, learnt about tokenization of a string, which makes work so much easier

  ## Key Learnings
  ### Communication Engineering
  - Calculation of entropy for joint probability distribution given for Huffman Coding sequence
  ### VLSI
  - Low power configurations
### Non-technical Book
  - Before you StartUp: Know your why's. Think about all easier options. Startup might not be the best idea for your dreams to come to reality.
### C++
  - Floating point types are error prone.
  - cout by default has 6 significant digits
  - Error can propagate when many mathematical operations are involved (+ and *). For example, 0.1 has a rounding error at its 17 significant digit, add 0.1 ten times and the error propagates to 16th sig. digit
  - Inf, NaN
  - std::boolalpha
  - std::cin.get() doesn't ignore whitespaces

  ## Key Learnings
   ### MATLAB
   - Simulation of ASK modulator and demodulator using Simulink
   - Introduction to Bernoulli binary generator
   - Extending ASK to achieve FSK which is nothing but addition of two ASK signals
   - Introduction to hardware simulation of a self balancing motorcycle which is programmed as an inverted pendulum
   - There are a lot of examples in simulink to go through, they each cover a unique concept
   - In MATLAB website there are way more apps, so we can use them to our advantage 

   ### C++
   - All about integers, modulo wrap around concept, why unsigned integers are unfavored, when an expression involves signed and unsigned operands, the signed operand is converted to unsigned.
   - Introduction to fixed width integers
   - Scientific notation

   ### Project Based Learning
   - Building a text editor in C
   - Difference between canonical and raw mode of terminal
   - Built a simple program which prints ASCII value of the character which I just give as input without pressing enter.
   - ECHO feature is what causes each key you type to be printed to terminal

  ## Key Learnings
  - C++ : Program terminated with signal SIGFPE, arithmetic exception error. Different data types. `void` is a special case. You can `return void()` from a function or just `return`. Review of Substring program (longest substring of non-repeating characters).
  - Before you StartUp book: Five major themes: Product, Competition, Cash, Legal System and Team
  - PCB Designing: Finished adding footprints, placed components roughly on the PCB
  - MATLAB: Basics of simulink and how to use it. Example projects: mobile rover, self-balancing robot, race car, automatic guitar tuner.
  - Some basics to be learnt: PID Control, low pass filtering, curve fitting, mean, median, std, scatter plot, FFT, inv of matrix, image segmentation, deep learning, optimization.

  ## Key Learnings
  - C++ for 3 hours
  - PCB designing: Finished the schematic design of STM32 + RF integration module. Learnt antenna impedance matching.
  - Dopamine Detox Book finished
  - Newton's Cradle Explained: Conservation of energy/momentum seems to be the wrong approach to explain it. There is something called Hertz's adjustment to Hookes' law
  - Reviewed some companies that specialise in RF domain
  - Project Based Learning in C: Writing a shell in C, learnt about tokenization of a string, which makes work so much easier

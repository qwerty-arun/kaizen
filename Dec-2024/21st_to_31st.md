  ## Key Learnings
  ### Machine Learning
  - Got started woth Python: Data types and variables, type casting from return value (string) to int, operators
  - Statistics: Analytic reasoning from just data of median and range of data.
  - Mean is very sensitive to outliers whereas median is not.
  - What is a General Purpose Technology (GPT)? Is AI and ML there yet?
  - Set up a playground for python too. Used the same makefiles to do so.
  - When I write into a file, the output automatically shows up. This works only for pre-defined inputs to the program.
  ### Entrepreneurship: Before you start up
  - A startup with weak foundation cannot be fixed
  - What skills must your co-founder have?
  - What are his professional ethics?
  - What is his goals for the company?
  - Are you comfortable the way he/she behaves around other people?
  - Importance of equity split, roles split, prenup etc.
  - What if you are not able to find your co-founder? Well, that should'nt stop you from chasing your dreams. Just get started, people will start joining when they see tangible results
  - Keep a time and money frame. This is the X amount of time I will keep going (before you quit) and Y money of money willing to burn.
  - Why 50/50 is not the equal split? Well, some founders work part-time.

  ## Key Learnings
  ### C++
  - Solved the climbing staris problem
  - Little bit about compile time and run time expressions, constant expressions
  ### Statistics course
  - Comparing datasets
  - Degree of skewness
  ### Before you startup book
  - What price will your target customers be willing to pay?
  - Making a MVP, acquire real customer and then expand
  - If you are spending money to acquire money, odds are you aren't creating value
  - Talk to industry experts: how to build, how to sell, what partnerships are required, current problems in the industry. Do you have the skills, commitment and network to make it work?
  - You best friend might not always be the best Co-founder?
  - Advice: Don't bring emotions
  ### Control Systems
  - Basic idea of what a system engineer does?

  ## Key Learnings
  ### Business Case Study
  - Building a business for a clothing industry.
  - We buy rolls of cloth, stitch them (shirts, t-shirts, jeans, ties, hankies) and sell them directly to customers (open your own outlet)
  - You will need CAs, designers, managers, packaging (clean, iron, then wrap), distribution, space, labour, machines, cloth
  - Labor and machine go hand in hand (more the machines you buy, more labour you need to operate them). If you have less machines and you need to achieve more results, then labour will have to work in shifts.
  - Build your own website, make sure your customers are aware of it. Also make it easy for them to order stuff online.
  - Innovate continuously without fail and perfect your product first.
  - Marketing, freebies to get people hooked to your product with the help of psychology.
  - Keep calling them (or emailing them) on monthly basis (get to know their perspective), get feedback.
  - Gain their trust, now they won't go anywhere.
  - Give a free shirt, then next month or so, offer them another shirt or another pant.
  - Give them an option for customizable products. Like printing whatever they like on t-shirts and stuff like that.
  - A company or business only grows when people in different departments talk to each other on regular basis. If you are an engineer, go talk to the sales manager, if you are a developer, go talk to the product designer and so on. Keep learning everything your company is doing.
  - Is your company doing a great job in delivering what it promises? If not, what can we optimize? To recognise this, you need to know in and out of your company. This only happens if you have connections. This can be a great oppurtunity for a startup.
  - Conduct only one meeting per week, gather atleast one person form every department and make them do a weekly review. Discuss all problems faced. This make all people aware of what's happening in the company. More importantly, keep reinforcing you vision for the company. Remind everyone of the vision and why you started the business in the first place.
  - To understand a business, understand its entire supply chain.
  - You don't need a revolutionary idea, you can think of doing an already existing thing in an efficient manner.

  ## Key Learnings
  ### C++ 
  - Implicit and explicit conversions
  - Usage of `static_cast` to perform explicit conversion
  - How many different ways in which we can perform explicit conversions?
  - Program of the day: Each element in an array should have unique no. of occurances. Ex: [1,2,2,1,1,3], 1 occurs three times, 2 occurs two times, 3 occurs 3 times
  - Wrote the program using some templates, using sort fuction which is inbuilt function
  - Problem: There are zeros involved, which makes it harder to understand

  ## Key Learnings
  ### Communication Engineering
  - Calculation of entropy for joint probability distribution given for Huffman Coding sequence
  ### VLSI
  - Low power configurations
### Non-technical Book
  - Before you StartUp: Know your why's. Think about all easier options. Startup might not be the best idea for your dreams to come to reality.
### C++
  - Floating point types are error prone.
  - cout by default has 6 significant digits
  - Error can propagate when many mathematical operations are involved (+ and *). For example, 0.1 has a rounding error at its 17 significant digit, add 0.1 ten times and the error propagates to 16th sig. digit
  - Inf, NaN
  - std::boolalpha
  - std::cin.get() doesn't ignore whitespaces

  ## Key Learnings
   ### MATLAB
   - Simulation of ASK modulator and demodulator using Simulink
   - Introduction to Bernoulli binary generator
   - Extending ASK to achieve FSK which is nothing but addition of two ASK signals
   - Introduction to hardware simulation of a self balancing motorcycle which is programmed as an inverted pendulum
   - There are a lot of examples in simulink to go through, they each cover a unique concept
   - In MATLAB website there are way more apps, so we can use them to our advantage 

   ### C++
   - All about integers, modulo wrap around concept, why unsigned integers are unfavored, when an expression involves signed and unsigned operands, the signed operand is converted to unsigned.
   - Introduction to fixed width integers
   - Scientific notation

   ### Project Based Learning
   - Building a text editor in C
   - Difference between canonical and raw mode of terminal
   - Built a simple program which prints ASCII value of the character which I just give as input without pressing enter.
   - ECHO feature is what causes each key you type to be printed to terminal

  - PCB Designing: Finished adding footprints, placed components roughly on the PCB
  - MATLAB: Basics of simulink and how to use it. Example projects: mobile rover, self-balancing robot, race car, automatic guitar tuner.

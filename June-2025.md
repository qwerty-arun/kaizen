- Microstrip patch antenna: construction, working, radiation mechanism, feeding methods and formulas involved

## Optic Fiber
- Light Sources: LED and type: Surface LED (SLED) and ELEDs.

## Machine Learning
- Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT: Hallucinations, combination of pre-trained and post-trained data, comparision of data with other LLMs, Model itself might not know who it is, fixed amount of computation in the Neural Networks, forcing a model to use code for calculations to get accurate results.

# General Discussion
- India-1, India-2 and India-3
- Consumptions across these tiers
- How to approach these levels?
- Singapore, Poland and Mexico model
- Singapore: premium, luxury and quiet luxury (stealth wealth)
- Poland: Comfortable, no loans, have gathered wealth
- Mexico: Have loans to pay, less purchasing ability
- India-2 helps India-2 lead a better life
- Value Addition in entire supply chain. 1kg rice of 40/- to 1kg biriyani of 280/-, that is a 7x value addition
- There are many costs: preparing, packaging, delivering etc.

# College Stuff

## Engineering Earth - by melodysheep
- Volcanoes: we could use their heat to make energy
- Putting SO2 into the atmosphere combats CO2 effectively
- Giant Solar Arrays blocking the sun's heat
- Editing plants: Edit their genes to grow advanced species which "eat" carbon. We could edit genes of algae, mammoths etc.
- Water is becoming more acidic due to CO2
- Shatter rocks of the ocean floor: It can absorb much more CO2
- Sunken ships which artificial reefs can support aquatic life more efficiently
- 100km of curtain to avoid warm ocean current to interact with glaciers
- Floating umbrellas to create Ice
- Just 0.3% area of Earth's surface is enough to power entire Earth. However, this can dramatically increase temperatures at the poles
- We could beam power down from space, but it can warm the planet up.
- Move power hungry industries into space, let them harness how much ever they require and use it, without absorbing any energy, this is the safest option
- Space elevators? This could bring launch costs to down to $100 per kg. This can be done using nuclear propulsion.
- Orbital Ring? Massive ecosystem around the Earth. Their shadows can affect life on Earth.

# Web Development
- Almost done with dropbox clone: Still many features to be added.

# General
- Deleted most apps: why do large applications have a separate app for uninstallation?

# Deep Dive into LLMs - Andrej
- Finished off with what LLMs are bad at
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)

# Web Development
- Done with Droply! It works!
- Things to later add: more file formats, create links and share, share and edit with other people (acess).

# Non-technical book: Do It Today
- We all escape from work some time or the other.
- Have a set of daily habits that you enjoy: reading, journalism, walking etc.
- Always keep learning how to sell. Deep dive into psychology, manipulation, persuasion etc.
## How to Focus
- Step-1: Eliminate all that is unnecesary. What things should I eliminate to make my life much simpler and is easier to focus.
- Step-2: Serotonin has a role to play in your focus. When low, we feel to escape. Think about past success for some time. 
- Self-regulation, self-control and willpower are those which we over-esitimate.
- From start to end of a task, there will be a moment where you give into a distraction. That is where you stop being productive.
- Willpower doesn't work. Systems Do: self-imposed deadlines, accountablity systems, working in intervals, exercising 30 mins a day, healthy diet, eliminating distractions, internal motivation.
- Why do you do what you do? If you know the answers, even the most annoying tasks become bearable.

## How to stop wasting time
- Step-1: Know thy time. Keep track of every minute. Keep an activity log. Do this for 2 weeks.
- Step-2: Indentify the non-productive work. Go through all activities. If you stop doing them?
- Step-3: Eliminate the time-wasters: Identify the critical tasks in your life and go all in.

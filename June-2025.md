# General
## Engineering Earth - by melodysheep
- Volcanoes: we could use their heat to make energy
- Putting SO2 into the atmosphere combats CO2 effectively
- Giant Solar Arrays blocking the sun's heat
- Editing plants: Edit their genes to grow advanced species which "eat" carbon. We could edit genes of algae, mammoths etc.
- Water is becoming more acidic due to CO2
- Shatter rocks of the ocean floor: It can absorb much more CO2
- Sunken ships which artificial reefs can support aquatic life more efficiently
- 100km of curtain to avoid warm ocean current to interact with glaciers
- Floating umbrellas to create Ice
- Just 0.3% area of Earth's surface is enough to power entire Earth. However, this can dramatically increase temperatures at the poles
- We could beam power down from space, but it can warm the planet up.
- Move power hungry industries into space, let them harness how much ever they require and use it, without absorbing any energy, this is the safest option
- Space elevators? This could bring launch costs to down to $100 per kg. This can be done using nuclear propulsion.
- Orbital Ring? Massive ecosystem around the Earth. Their shadows can affect life on Earth.

# Web Development
- Done with Droply! It works!
- Things to later add: more file formats, create links and share, share and edit with other people (acess).

# Non-technical book: Do It Today
- We all escape from work some time or the other.
- Have a set of daily habits that you enjoy: reading, journalism, walking etc.
- Always keep learning how to sell. Deep dive into psychology, manipulation, persuasion etc.
## How to Focus
- Step-1: Eliminate all that is unnecesary. What things should I eliminate to make my life much simpler and is easier to focus.
- Step-2: Serotonin has a role to play in your focus. When low, we feel to escape. Think about past success for some time. 
- Self-regulation, self-control and willpower are those which we over-esitimate.
- From start to end of a task, there will be a moment where you give into a distraction. That is where you stop being productive.
- Willpower doesn't work. Systems Do: self-imposed deadlines, accountablity systems, working in intervals, exercising 30 mins a day, healthy diet, eliminating distractions, internal motivation.
- Why do you do what you do? If you know the answers, even the most annoying tasks become bearable.

## How to stop wasting time
- Step-1: Know thy time. Keep track of every minute. Keep an activity log. Do this for 2 weeks.
- Step-2: Indentify the non-productive work. Go through all activities. If you stop doing them?
- Step-3: Eliminate the time-wasters: Identify the critical tasks in your life and go all in.

# NO_PUBKEY error fix while `sudo apt update`
- The NO_PUBKEY error during sudo apt-get update in Kali Linux (or any Debian-based Linux distro) means that one of the repositories you're trying to fetch from is signed with a GPG key, but your system doesn't have the corresponding public key to verify the package index files.
- **Commands in order**:
```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ABCD1234EFGH5678
gpg --export ABCD1234EFGH5678 | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/missingkey.gpg > /dev/null
```
- If you run `sudo apt-get update`, it should update


# Virtual Environments in Python: Installing jupyter notebook
- error: externally-managed-environment
- This is not a bug — it’s a safety feature in newer Python (PEP 668) to prevent system-wide Python package changes on Debian-based distros like Kali Linux, Ubuntu, etc., which can break core system tools.
- **Option 1:** `pip3 install notebook --break-system-packages` will break or interfere with system-installed python packages
- **Option 2:** Use Virtual Environment:
```bash
# Step 1: Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Step 2: Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install Jupyter Notebook inside it
pip install notebook

# Step 4: Run it
jupyter notebook

# Step 5: Exit the virtual environment
deactivate
```
- This keeps everything isolated and avoids affecting system-wide python
- Virtual Environment is like a sandbox, if you delete it, the packages installed within it will also be deleted.

# NumPy Learnings
- Learnt about many array and matrices functions
- Applied them, compiled them in one full notebook using Colab
- Wrote some basic and intermediate programs

# Large files in git
- Never upload node modules in git repo
- They can easily be over 100MB exceeding the limit set up by git: 100MB
- Option 1: Delete the node modules repo and push
- Option 2: add `nodemodules/` to `.gitignore` file, but this didn't work for me
- Alternatively, we can use Git LFS:
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.node"
git add .gitattributes
git add path/to/your/file.node
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
git push origin main
```

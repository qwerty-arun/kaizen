  # Key Learnings
  - SFML: Basic game setup using classes pointer and much more. Topics learnt: header files (precompiled header files), pointers, classes, this keyword, commenting every function and providing accurate description of the function
  - PCB Designing: Wrong traces (5V for GND etc) and its correction, making a box for the PCB, types and fine tuning for our needs
  - CAD Modeling: Trying to animate Schmidt Coupling mechanism
  - DSA in C: Some more problems in LL, tried out codeforces and leetcode

  # Key Learnings
  - How does Gravity even work? In curved spacetime, you need to accelerate just to stand still? GMm/r^2 = ma
  - 'm' on the left side is the gravitational mass and 'm' on the right is the inertial mass. So, are they different or the same?
  - An accelerating frame of reference bends light.
  - Charged particle left stationary V/S free fall. Using Newton's theory: in the former case, there is no radiation because there is no radiation and in the latter case, there is radiation becoz there is acceleration. Whereas in general relativity, in the former case, there is radiation because there is acceleration, and in the latter case, there is no radiation becoz there is no acceleration.

  ## Non-Technical Book - The Power of your Subconscious Mind
  - Plant seeds of harmony, health and good will into your subconscious mind. Control your thoughts.
  - There is the infinity within you! Unleash its full power and live in harmony.
  - It has all the answers to your questions and can heal you from any state

  ## Physics Engine 
  - Changing real world values in order for it to work in games. Example: g = 10 -> 15 to 25
  - In games mass has to be more than the mass in real life. del(m) = (del(s))^2 [s is speed]
  - A 5g bullet with velocity of 500 m/s -> 2 kg and 25m/s velocity in the game. del(s) is 20, then change in mass will be its squared = 400
  - Particle Physics Engine done. Fireworks simulation complete.
  - Mass aggregate physics to be learnt.
  - Idea of an interface and polymorphism: In C++, we use a base class and a pure virtual function. In this way, we ensure that we can't create an instance of base class. Each derived class has to implement all its methods before it can be instantiated.

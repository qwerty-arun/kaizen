  # Key Learnings
  - SFML: Basic game setup using classes pointer and much more. Topics learnt: header files (precompiled header files), pointers, classes, this keyword, commenting every function and providing accurate description of the function
  - PCB Designing: Wrong traces (5V for GND etc) and its correction, making a box for the PCB, types and fine tuning for our needs
  - CAD Modeling: Trying to animate Schmidt Coupling mechanism
  - DSA in C: Some more problems in LL, tried out codeforces and leetcode
  - Brief History of Time: Four fundamental forces, virtual particles, quarks, spin of particles etc.
  - 3D printing course: Friction Lamination, an improvement to Friction steer welding. A rod is used as a feedstock, rotated at a pre-determined speed, metal turns into putty like structure and then is deposited. This process is much safer than other methods.
  - Making of a Satellite: Its various components.

  ## College Stuff
  - Antenna Basic Terminology: gain, solid angle, power etc.
  - Operating Systems: Types, its functions, abstract views.

  # Key Learnings
  - How does Gravity even work? In curved spacetime, you need to accelerate just to stand still? GMm/r^2 = ma
  - 'm' on the left side is the gravitational mass and 'm' on the right is the inertial mass. So, are they different or the same?
  - An accelerating frame of reference bends light.
  - Charged particle left stationary V/S free fall. Using Newton's theory: in the former case, there is no radiation because there is no radiation and in the latter case, there is radiation becoz there is acceleration. Whereas in general relativity, in the former case, there is radiation because there is acceleration, and in the latter case, there is no radiation becoz there is no acceleration.

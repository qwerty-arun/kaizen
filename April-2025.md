  # Key Learnings
  - SFML: Basic game setup using classes pointer and much more. Topics learnt: header files (precompiled header files), pointers, classes, this keyword, commenting every function and providing accurate description of the function
  - PCB Designing: Wrong traces (5V for GND etc) and its correction, making a box for the PCB, types and fine tuning for our needs
  - CAD Modeling: Trying to animate Schmidt Coupling mechanism
  - DSA in C: Some more problems in LL, tried out codeforces and leetcode
  - Brief History of Time: Four fundamental forces, virtual particles, quarks, spin of particles etc.
  - 3D printing course: Friction Lamination, an improvement to Friction steer welding. A rod is used as a feedstock, rotated at a pre-determined speed, metal turns into putty like structure and then is deposited. This process is much safer than other methods.
  - Making of a Satellite: Its various components.

  ## College Stuff
  - Antenna Basic Terminology: gain, solid angle, power etc.
  - Operating Systems: Types, its functions, abstract views.

  ## College Stuff
  - Antenna Theory: More terminology and derivation
  - Optic Fiber: basics
  - Data Communication and Networking: No idea!
  - DCN Lab: CRC code (like cyclic code), but there was an error

  # Key Learnings
  - Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow book glimpse: System 1 and System 2 of our brains
  - Optic Fiber: Wave Equations, wavefronts, Maxwell's equations, linear polarization and circular/elliptical polarization.
  - Operating Systems: Types of OS- Batch Processing, Multi-programming, time-sharing, real-time, distributed and Modern-Day OS
  - Colossal Structures in our solar system: Asteroid Belt, Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.
  - CAD Modeling: Finished with Schmidt Coupling
  - PCB Designing: Done with the tutorial, no more!
  - SFML: Some more ideas, learnt soft body dynamics, how the hell do you implement that?
